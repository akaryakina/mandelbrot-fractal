Generated: <div id="percent" style="display:inline">0</div>%<br />

- this thing does not work as expected for displaying image generation progress, 
it only displays "100%" after generation is finished.


this is the way to put style width and height to css (but currently implemented in .js):
canvas {
    border: 1px dotted black;
    width:800px; height:600px
}
